    p1: "“As the founder of 828 LLC, it is my responsibility to always maintain the integrity environment of the company, combined with the highest standards of quality, efficiency, reliability, and customer service. The technical aspect, the knowledge of what we do, is obviously very important to be able to provide our services. But we believe that they should be combined with the best customer service possible. We are “freaks” of customer service, and are totally convinced that without it, both our company and the relationships with our clients would not be alive on a long-term basis. We are committed to providing the best possible technical knowledge and implementation of that knowledge in HVAC, in engineering, and in projects in general. That leads us to the complete trust of our clients. We are a team, and every aspect of our business is managed with that in mind. If you have tried us, I hope that you had the best experience. And if not, please give us the opportunity to do what we do. Hard work, dedication!”",
