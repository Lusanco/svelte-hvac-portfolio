          “As the founder of 828 LLC, it is my responsibility to always maintain
          the integrity environment of the company, combined with the highest
          standards of quality, efficiency, reliability, and customer service.
          The technical aspect, the knowledge of what we do, is obviously very
          important to be able to provide our services. But we believe that they
          should be combined with the best customer service possible. We are
          “freaks” of customer service, and are totally convinced that without
          it, both our company and the relationships with our clients would not
          be alive on a long-term basis. We are committed to providing the best
          possible technical knowledge and implementation of that knowledge in
          HVAC, in engineering, and in projects in general. That leads us to the
          complete trust of our clients. We are a team, and every aspect of our
          business is managed with that in mind. If you have tried us, I hope
          that you had the best experience. And if not, please give us the
          opportunity to do what we do. Hard work, dedication!”
